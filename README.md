**SN-Orchestra** is a coordination-layer subnet on the Bittensor network. We solve the "Fragmentation Gap" by providing a centralized neural hub that manages specialized decentralized agents across the ecosystem.

## 📖 Subnet Overview
In the 2026 decentralized AI landscape, intelligence is abundant but heavily siloed. Users currently interface with separate subnets for coding, data retrieval, and compute. **SN-Orchestra** introduces a new commodity to the network: **Orchestration Intelligence**.

Instead of performing raw compute, this subnet specializes in **Strategic Management**. It takes a single, complex user intent and intelligently delegates it across the 128+ subnets of Bittensor, synthesizing the results into one high-fidelity solution.

### Core Functions:
* **Intent Decomposition:** Breaking complex human prompts into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of actionable sub-tasks.
* **Expert Procurement:** Identifying and "hiring" the most reputable UIDs from specialized subnets (e.g., Code from SN62, Search from SN13).
* **Consensus Synthesis:** Aggregating disparate outputs and verifying cryptographic execution proofs to ensure a "Chain of Trust."

## 🏗️ How it Works
The subnet utilizes a **Manager-Auditor** relationship to maintain the highest standards of decentralized logic:

1.  **Miners (The Managers):** These nodes are the "brains" of the operation. They receive tasks, create execution plans, pay for services on other subnets, and deliver the final synthesized product.
2.  **Validators (The Auditors):** These nodes are the "referees." They verify that miners are using legitimate expert nodes and that the final output is logically sound and accurate.
3.  **The Synapse:** All communication is handled via a standardized contract that ensures every task has a verifiable "paper trail" of cross-subnet execution.

## 🏛️ Vision
SN-Orchestra is committed to the decentralized expansion of Bittensor. By acting as the "connective tissue" between subnets, we aim to increase the utility and total value locked (TVL) of every participant in the ecosystem.
