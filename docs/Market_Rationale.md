## 💼 Business Logic & Market Rationale

### The "Fragmented Intelligence" Problem
As of 2026, the Bittensor network has over 120 active subnets. For a developer, calling 10 different APIs with 10 different token requirements is a major friction point.

### The Orchestra Solution
Orchestra provides a **Unified Intelligence Layer**.
* **Simplification:** One API, one payment, one response.
* **Cost Advantage:** Because miners compete to find the cheapest/best expert subnets, Orchestra can offer services at up to **85% lower costs** than centralized alternatives like AWS Bedrock or OpenAI.

### Strategic Positioning
Orchestra is not a competitor to SN1 or SN64; it is their **biggest customer**. By increasing the volume of cross-subnet traffic, Orchestra creates a "rising tide" that lifts the value of the entire Bittensor ecosystem.
