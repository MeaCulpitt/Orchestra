# Orchestra: Go-To-Market Strategy

Orchestra launches with two products: managed orchestration and the Subnet Ledger. The GTM strategy prioritizes the Ledger (faster adoption, lower friction) while building orchestration demand in parallel.

---

## Phase 1: Ledger First (Months 1-3)

### Goal

Establish the Subnet Ledger as the canonical reference for Bittensor capabilities.

### Target Users

| Segment | Need | Value Prop |
|---------|------|------------|
| Bittensor developers | "What subnets exist and how do I call them?" | One API instead of GitHub spelunking |
| Subnet owners | "How do people discover my subnet?" | Listed in the standard registry |
| Agent builders | "How do I route tasks to Bittensor?" | Capability-based lookup |

### Tactics

**1. Seed the Ledger**

Miners catalogue the top 50 subnets before launch. Day 1 coverage establishes credibility.

**2. Free tier for developers**

Basic Ledger access is free. Developers try it, integrate it, depend on it.

**3. Subnet owner outreach**

Contact subnet teams directly:
- "We're building the canonical Bittensor registry"
- "Verify your entry for accuracy"
- "Get listed before launch"

This creates buy-in and ensures accuracy.

**4. Documentation + examples**

Publish integration guides:
- "How to query the Ledger"
- "Route your LangChain agent through Bittensor"
- "Discover subnets by capability"

### Success Criteria

- 50+ subnets catalogued
- 100+ developers using free tier
- 3+ subnet teams actively verifying entries

---

## Phase 2: Orchestration Launch (Months 3-6)

### Goal

Convert Ledger users to orchestration customers.

### Target Users

| Segment | Need | Value Prop |
|---------|------|------------|
| Agent framework users | Multi-step tasks on Bittensor | One call instead of manual routing |
| Enterprises exploring Bittensor | "Can we use this without a dedicated team?" | Managed service, no integration |
| Power users | Complex research/analysis tasks | Structured output, verified execution |

### Tactics

**1. Upgrade path from Ledger**

Users querying the Ledger for routing → offer orchestration:
- "You're calling 3 subnets manually. Want us to handle it?"
- Free trial for first 10 orchestration jobs

**2. Template library**

Pre-built orchestration templates for common tasks:
- Market research
- Competitive analysis
- Data aggregation
- Content synthesis

Lower barrier: users start with templates, customize later.

**3. Integration partnerships**

Partner with agent frameworks:
- LangChain: Orchestra as a tool/backend
- CrewAI: Orchestra for Bittensor routing
- AutoGen: Orchestra as execution layer

**4. Case studies**

Publish real examples:
- "How [Company] uses Orchestra for [Task]"
- Actual cost, latency, output quality
- Before/after comparison with DIY

### Success Criteria

- 1,000+ orchestration jobs per week
- 70%+ success rate
- 5+ enterprise pilots

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 6-12)

### Goal

Become default infrastructure for Bittensor coordination.

### Tactics

**1. Enterprise sales**

Dedicated outreach to companies exploring Bittensor:
- Custom SLAs
- Dedicated support
- Volume pricing

**2. Ledger licensing**

License Ledger access to platforms:
- Agent framework providers
- Bittensor explorers/dashboards
- Analytics platforms

**3. Ecosystem integration**

Deep integration with Bittensor tooling:
- Bittensor CLI integration
- Wallet/staking platform partnerships
- Developer tool bundles

**4. Geographic expansion**

Localized documentation and support for:
- Asia-Pacific markets
- European enterprises
- Emerging crypto markets

### Success Criteria

- 10,000+ orchestration jobs per week
- 3+ enterprise contracts
- Ledger recognized as industry standard

## Pricing Strategy

### Ledger

| Tier | Access | Price |
|------|--------|-------|
| Free | Basic schema lookup, rate-limited | $0 |
| Developer | Full schemas, 1,000 lookups/month | $10/month |
| Production | Unlimited, webhooks for changes | $100/month |
| Enterprise | SLA, custom integration, support | Custom |

Free tier drives adoption. Paid tiers capture value from serious users.

### Orchestration

| Model | Price |
|-------|-------|
| Per-job | Subnet costs + 20% margin |
| Volume | Tiered discounts at 1K, 10K, 100K jobs/month |
| Enterprise | Custom pricing, committed volume |

Margin covers miner coordination work + protocol sustainability.

## Marketing Channels

### Developer-focused

| Channel | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Twitter/X | Technical threads, subnet spotlights, orchestration demos |
| Discord | Bittensor community presence, support channel |
| GitHub | Open docs, example repos, issue responsiveness |
| Dev blogs | Integration tutorials, architecture deep-dives |

### Enterprise-focused

| Channel | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Direct outreach | Targeted emails to AI/ML teams at target companies |
| Conferences | Bittensor events, AI infrastructure conferences |
| Case studies | Published success stories with metrics |
| Partnerships | Co-marketing with agent framework providers |

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Message: "The coordination layer Bittensor needs"

**For developers:**
> "Stop integrating subnets one by one. Query the Ledger. Call Orchestra. Ship faster."

**For enterprises:**
> "Use Bittensor without building an integration team. One API, structured results, verified execution."

**For subnet owners:**
> "Get discovered. Orchestra routes traffic to you based on capabilities, not connections."

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low initial Ledger coverage | Pre-seed top 50 subnets before launch |
| Orchestration quality issues | Start with simple templates, expand carefully |
| Enterprise sales cycle too long | Focus on developer adoption first, enterprises follow |
| Competition from another subnet | Move fast, establish standard before alternatives emerge |

---

## Summary

**Month 1-3:** Ledger as the canonical Bittensor registry. Free tier, developer adoption, subnet team buy-in.

**Month 3-6:** Orchestration launch. Convert Ledger users, template library, framework partnerships.

**Month 6-12:** Scale. Enterprise sales, Ledger licensing, ecosystem integration.

The Ledger is the wedge. Orchestration is the business.
