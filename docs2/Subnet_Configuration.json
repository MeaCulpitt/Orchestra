# ⚙️ Subnet Configuration: SN-Orchestra Dual Mechanism

This configuration defines the split between "Strategic Routing" and "Data Standardization." By setting these hyperparameters, the subnet owner ensures that miners are incentivized to not only find the right experts but also to return perfectly structured data.

## 1. Emission Split Configuration
Using the `sudo_set_mechanism_emission_split` operation, the subnet total emission (alpha_out) is divided between two internal mechanisms.
